# SysLPX
Specialized Version of masc4ii's Sysex Live


Adds:

   - Row selection via incoming MIDI Program Changes.
   - Number of Synths changed from 2 to 4.
   - Loads patchlist "default.syxml" by default.
   - New last row which loads row with a double-click.

Issues
  - Not sure I provided for systems with no MIDI input.
  - Most if not all new lines and/or sections marked with "rockumk" so that my poor programming could be quickly checked.
  - Couldn't figure out how to send row with a single rather than double click or how to make the cell non-editable.
  - Probably others I can't think of.
  
  
Goal is to eventually create a specialized version for certain musical gear devices.
